The other weekend, I lost my wallet on the streets of Manhattan. Let me clarify: I was sitting on some stairs, talking on the phone with my mother, and pulled it out to fidget with it. When I got up to leave, I just left it there.  Y'know, just left it there.

Never a desirable thing to have happen to you, I was inconsolable about it.  It exacts a certain kind of self-loathing, and it makes you feel like an imbecile.  How can I just leave my wallet somewhere on the streets of Manhattan?

Well, after some retracing of steps and a few interviews with door persons, bank tellers and even the hot dog cart guy on the corner, I gave up.  Tail in-between my legs, I started making the calls.  Credit card after credit card, I called the hotlines to piece my wallet back together.

The items started rolling back in, and I was returning to normalcy.

--------------------------

The day I got my reissued debit card in the mail, I also received an envelope from the police precinct of Lower Manhattan.  Lo, and behold!  A good samaritan had found my wallet and turned it in to the police.  Literally everything in it, including my cash, was still there.

Henery Couper.  Man of the hour.  Found my wallet and turned it in.  His name was on the evidence receipt, as was his address.  He'll shortly be receiving a package filled with [Butter + Love](http://butterpluslove.com) cookies.

--------------------------

Off to the police precinct I went.  If you've been to Lower Manhattan, especially around the courthouse area, you'll know that's it's a byzantine maze of concrete, granite and tourists.  Trying to locate the place where I needed to get my wallet took two trips (one was a complete failure to find where I needed to go, and I ran out of time) and a long chain of conversations with police officers.

*"Look, I'm picking up a wallet that I left on the street.  I just need to pick it up.  Where do I go?  She told me to come here.  So go that way?  Hi, I'm trying to get my wallet.  Go the other way?  Okay."*

Finally, having located the entrance, I'm standing in line to go through security.  My mistake entirely, but I had my bike with me and had forgotten my lock, and security wasn't willing to let me bring it with me through the complex.  Not an unreasonable request, I asked what I could do with it.  "Look, guy.  Just go buy a lock.  It's a Cannondale, and it's a nice one.  Someone's gonna walk off with it."  

At this point, I had been through too much to bike back home, and I didn't want to go buy a lock, as I have two at home.  I walked out of the security building and looked around.  A ways down, I saw a group of protesters fighting against the injustices of "stop and frisk", a real problem in the NYC criminal system.  I walked over to the group - there were only four or five of them at this point - and shook hands with a man holding the corner of a large banner.

*"Hey, man.  I'm just trying to get my wallet from evidence, and I need a place to set my bike.  Can I just leave it here next to you?"*

*"Aw, man.  How long are you gonna be?  You're just gonna set it right there?  Alright, I'll watch it for you.  You're not gonna be long, though, right?"*

*"I'll just be like 5 or 10 minutes"*

*"Alright, just set it there.  Don't take too long, though."*

--------------------------

I made my way through the nonsense of hoops they make a visitor jump through.  After walking through the metal detector and having my belongings scanned, I walked to a kiosk to enter my first and last name, and to have my picture taken.  Then, after getting a receipt, I walked across the courtyard to another building where I waited in line to receive a printed orange sticker with my name and picture on it.  Then, through another line and into the evidence area, where I waited in another line.

Finally, I reached the evidence teller.

*"How are you, officer?"*

*"Always swell."*

I gave him the evidence sheet that had been mailed to me, and my passport.  

*"Okay, what's your second piece of ID?"*

*"What do you mean?  This is all I have.  The rest is in my wallet with you."*

After talking it over for a minute with a coworker, he made an exception for me and handed over my wallet, everything included.

--------------------------

I ran back to the protest, worried that I had taken too long and the protest had ended.  Turns out, it was in full swing, with press interviews, speeches, and peaceful displays of dissatisfaction with the current system.

I looked around, and there was my bike, sitting in the same place it was before.

I grabbed, it walked over to the guy who had watched it for me, and put my hand on his shoulder.

*"Hey.  Thanks for watching this for me.  Really."*

*"Hey, brother.  Always watching out."*

--------------------------

*"Always watching out."*

Throughout this whole ordeal, the people in this city were looking out for me.  In small and big ways, my community was looking out for me.  In the most unlikely of cities, or at least the most unexpected of cities, people took care of me and helped me recover from my mistakes.  

That's community.  That's my church.

People helping each other out through the struggles, mistakes or misfortunes that we go through.  Man, that's the good stuff.  And it was a touching reminder to me to be an active member of that community, and to look out for my fellow New Yorkers when I can.
