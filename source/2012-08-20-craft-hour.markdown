An important part of working from home is being comfortable. This can be the chair that you sit in while you're working, or the cleanliness of the room you're surrounded by.  It even extends to the music you listen to.  Being comfortable helps give you the optimal configuration to be productive, efficient and happy.

On occassion, I'll work from my ladyfriend's apartment, but whenever I do, I really struggled with getting comfortable at her desk.  It doesn't have my external monitor, my iPad dock, my lamp, etc.  But the worst part is that the desk is too shallow in depth, so my forearms can practically extend from the front to the back of the surface.  This is really uncomfortable for working long hours at the computer, and can make the position of my wrists and the angle of my hands problematic.

So today, during that 2pm slump, I decided to see if I could put on my arts and crafts hat and come up with a solution to the desk space issue.

I knew that the best way for me to optimize my space was to make the laptop open up as far as possible and somehow hold the most forward edge of the bottom half of the laptop towards the back of the desk, so that's it appears to be standing on its front edge and is as open to me as possible.  Here's an example image of what I was going for:

because I didn't want to go out to the store to buy something like this, I wandered around the house looking for something that I could coerce into the right tool for the job.  I had a few parameters:

* Free
* Removeable (i.e. not affixed permanently to the table)
* Not damaging to the surface of the table
* Would work for both my Macbook Air and her Macbook

So I found a pair of star-shaped cookie cutters that we had used the previous day for an [exclusive kids' baking event for Feelday](http://feelday.com/activity/993/mustache-cookie-party).  I got out my pair of needle-nose pliers and began to flatten out the stars so that I ended up with two sturdy, flat, long strips of metal.  Then, I procceeded to sketch out the shape of these two holders.  Here's a picture of my diagram:

Once I folded the metal out to fit the specification I had laid out, I added a few small bigs of the soft side of some velcro to the parts of the stands where the laptop would make contact and where it made contact with the table, just to provide padding.

And they turned out perfectly!  They hold my laptop up almost vertical and make my laptop lean easily against the window I face.  There's no damage to either my laptop or the table, and I can quickly pull both stands off and store them away when I'm not working.  Win!
